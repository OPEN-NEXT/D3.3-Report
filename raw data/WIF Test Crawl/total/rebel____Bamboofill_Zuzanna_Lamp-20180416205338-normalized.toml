function = "A remix of the <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:730263\">Zuzanna Lamp</a> by the extremely talented LeFabShop, which unfortunately had to close down last year. Think their designs really show the potential for 3D printing to design complex, beautiful designs. This print was my first test of Bamboofill, with gives a very elegant finish."
