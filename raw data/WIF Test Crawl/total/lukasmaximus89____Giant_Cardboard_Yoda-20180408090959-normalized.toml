function = "Heres a bust of Yoda I made from cardboard as a decoration for a maker space I used to run. It was made by manipulating a 3D model I found of Yoda on thingiverse with the Autodesk software 123dDesign. I then cut all the pieces out on a large scale laser cutter and assembled the pieces one by one."
