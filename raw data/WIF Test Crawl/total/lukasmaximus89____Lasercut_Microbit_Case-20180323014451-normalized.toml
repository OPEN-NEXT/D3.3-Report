function = "This is a an acrylic case I designed for the BBC Microbit to help protect the delicate chips on the back surface. I felt the need to design this case after I noticed some of the accelerometer chips had fallen off my Microbits whilst in my bag. It also helps avoid shorting the test pads on the back."
