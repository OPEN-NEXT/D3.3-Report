function = "I am designing and fabricating an open source 3d printer, using aluminum for the frame rather than wood or plastic. My welding skills and cnc plasma table give me all I need to design a machine closer to a commercial model; and instead of using an arduino, I'm using the skr mini e3 v2 motherboard."
