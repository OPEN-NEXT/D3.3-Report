function = "Idea is to create machines that perform tasks like lawn mowing, plowing slowly.\nThis way the machines are less intrusive and more quiet. They can blend into environment. \n\nExample:\nBug like machine that is powered by the sun that mows the loan but does so slowly. Maybe it takes a week to mow 1 acre."
