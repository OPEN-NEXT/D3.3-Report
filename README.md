## Original task description

Task 3.3: Development of the metadatabase using Wikibase instance\
Lead Partner: [FHG](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/)\
Participants: [WMDE](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/)

In this task, a new Wikibase instance is installed and set up in order to host OSH-related data. The necessary servers to run the instance will be provided by TUB. The installation will be performed by the FHG, who has access to TUB resources, and will be supported by WMDE, who provide the technical knowledge. The Wikibase instance will be configured with an OSH-specific data model gained from WP2 (task 2.3). GSCOP will provide requirements for structuring OSH-data which will be translated into a computable data model by
WMDE and IPK. The configuration of the Wikibase instance will be performed in an iterative process between WP2 and WP3 along the progress made by WP2 to define an OSH documentation standard. This iterative integration of the data model is allowed by the flexible structure of the Wikibase instance. Database maintenance will be performed by FHG along the project timeframe. At the end of the project, FHG will hand it over to Open Source Ecology Germany e.V. (OSEG), who accepted to perform maintenance tasks free of
charge for a three-year period after the project. Once the database is set up and sufficiently populated (see task 3.4), WMDE will provide training for project participants on how to query data in the software.

## Who is doing this?

[OPEN_NEXT](https://opennext.eu/) is a collaboration
between 19 industry and academic partners
across Europe.
Funded by the [European Union](https://europa.eu/)'s
[Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) programme,
this project seeks to enable small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
to work with consumers, makers, and other communities in rethinking
how products are designed and produced.
[Open source hardware](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/)
is a key enabler of this goal
where the design of a physical product is released with the freedoms
for anyone to study, modify, share, and redistribute copies.
These essential freedoms are based on those of [open source software](https://opensource.org/osd),
which is itself derived from [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
where the word free refers to freedom, *not* free-of-charge.
When put in practice,
these freedoms could potentially not only reduce proprietary vendor lock-in,
planned obsolescence, or waste but also stimulate novel –
even disruptive – business models.
The SME partners in OPENNEXT are experimenting
with producing open source hardware and even opening up the development process
to wider community participation.
They produce diverse products ranging from [desks](https://stykka.com/),
[cargo bike modules](http://www.xyzcargo.com/),
to a [digital scientific instrument platform](https://pslab.io/)
(and [more](https://opennext.eu/project-team/#sme)).

The work carried out in this repository is subject to WP3 of OPEN!NEXT
("Supporting production engineering with ICT infrastructure")
and lead by the [department of Information and Process Control
at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/en/about-us/organization/virtual-product-creation.html).
